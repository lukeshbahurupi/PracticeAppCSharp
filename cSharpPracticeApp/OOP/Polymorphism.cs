/*
 * Polymorphism is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and refers to the ability of different objects
 * (classes) to be treated as objects of a common base class, often allowing them to respond to the same method calls in different ways.
 * It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types through a common interface or base class,
 * making your code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

There are two types of polymorphism in C#:

1. **Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism * *: This is achieved through method overloading and operator overloading.

2. **Run-time (Dynamic) Polymorphism * *: This is achieved through method overriding and interface-based polymorphism.

        **Method Overloading**:
        Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. 
        The correct method is determined at compile time based on the number and types of arguments passed to the method.
